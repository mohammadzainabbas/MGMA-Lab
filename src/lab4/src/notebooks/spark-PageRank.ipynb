    "# 5. Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to implement a function $multiply()$ to obtain the matrix $A \\times B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $multiply()$ takes in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $A$: an RDD containing the first matrix.\n",
    "- $B$: an RDD containing the second matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function $multiply$ returns an RDD containing the matrix obtained by multiplying the first and the second matrix.\n",
    "The multiplication can only be computed if the number of columns of $A$ equals the number of rows of $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $A$ be an $n \\times m$ matrix and $B$ an $m \\times p$ matrix.\n",
    "The matrix $C = A \\times B$ is a $n \\times p$ matrix, where each element $c_{i, k}$ is computed as \n",
    "follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{i, k} = \\sum\\limits_{j=0}^{m-1} a_{i, j} \\cdot b_{j, k} \\quad\\quad (1)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "One possible implementation of this function is based on a MapReduce schema.\n",
    "Remember that in a MapReduce schema, the idea is to group elements by a key and apply a function to the elements \n",
    "that share the same key.\n",
    "As you can see, for a given $(i, k)$, the element of $A$ that is in the j-th column is multiplied by the value of $B$ that is in the j-th row, for any column $j$.\n",
    "Therefore, we can change the representation of $A$ and $B$ so that their elements are indexed by using $j$ as the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we can represent the matrix $A$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(j, (0, i, a_{i, j})) \\quad 0 \\leq i \\leq n-1 \\quad 0 \\leq j \\leq m-1  \\quad\\quad (2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the value $0$ in the triple $(0, i, a_{i, j})$ means that the element $a_{i, j}$ comes from the matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can represent the matrix $B$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(j, (1, k, b_{j, k})) \\quad 0 \\leq j \\leq m-1 \\quad 0 \\leq k \\leq p-1 \\quad\\quad (3) $\n",
    "\n",
    "where the value $1$ in the triple $(1, k, b_{j, k})$ means that the element $b_{j, k}$ comes from the matrix $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we want to code two functions $transformA()$ and $transformB()$ to obtain the two representations of $A$ and $B$ respectively, as described in Equation (2) and (3).\n",
    "The two representations returned by both functions **must be RDDs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete the definition of the functions $transformA()$ and $transformB()$ and execute the code**"
